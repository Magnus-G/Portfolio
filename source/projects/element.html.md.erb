# The Element Radiator

![Project Image](images/projects/9.jpg "Project Image")
      
A conceptual design for a radiator. 35 bulbs give just as much heat and energy as a normal radiator with the exception that it constantly shows its status with its bright light. This prototype aims at visualizing the energy consumed while heating the home as it reacts to the thermal properties of the room. My focus in this project was on concept development, prototype construction, design and graphical presentation. I designed this during my 1,5 years at the Interactive Institute in Sweden. Anton Gustafsson did all the electronics and programming.
