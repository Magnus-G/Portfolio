# Sonicspree Music Game

![Project Image](images/projects/38_3.png "Project Image")

A music game for the Windows Tablet and the Microsoft surface table. The game is a bit like a music memory game. A song is streamed from Spotify and it's up to the players to flip cards to reveal different album covers. If a player can match a cover to the song being played, he or she needs to drag it to his or her "nest" in order to gain points. If other players also recognize the cover, the fight is on to steal the card!
