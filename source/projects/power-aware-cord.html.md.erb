# The Power-Aware Cord

![Project Image](images/projects/8.jpg "Project Image")
      
Designed to visualise the current use of electricity of the appliances connected with it through glowing pulses, flow, and intensity of light.The cord may be used as a tool for people to rediscover energy in their homes as well as an ambient display to see energy consumption at a glance at any given time. I designed this during my 1,5 years at the Interactive Institute in Sweden. Anton Gustafsson did all the electronics and programming.
