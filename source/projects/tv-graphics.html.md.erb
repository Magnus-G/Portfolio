### tv.nu

# Graphic Design Projects

## Background
tv.nu is Sweden's largest aggregating streaming and linear TV guide with 2 million unique visitors each week. It was founded in 1999 and is today running on iOS, Android and the web.

## Challenges
As I came onboard the streaming guide suffered from a lot of UI challenges as it was riddled with inconsistencies, half-finished designs and was lacking many crucial elements to really inspire, inform and help users find something good to watch.

## Modernizing the brand
tv.nu had just updated its logo and its use of brand colors and the UI needed to reflect this modernization. On the checklist were issues such as coherency across components as well as letting the apps speak the same brand language, reducing the number of components doing the same thing and to create a design system to simplify further implementation.

***Old design on the left, new design to the right with detail pages opened in context instead of directing to new page.***

    minimizing the number of colors and fonts used.

***For illustrations I developed a somewhat whimsical, playful style to let the brand come across as friendly***

## Legibility
A fairly low-hanging fruit was tackling the poor legibility in headers. Previous efforts had prioritized a strict use of brand colors which rendered failing contrast tests.

By promoting a dark and rather unsaturated shade of blue that went well with the brand colors the yellow color was allowed step down from its prominent position. Instead it became prominent in a more useful way – as an signal color for selected areas.

## Multitenancy Project
The Norwegian magazine VG needed to modernize their linear TV guide and make the same transition tv.nu and decided to team up after seeing the new design.

This turned tv.nu into a multitenancy platform that put higher demands on design and development to thighten up the overall consistency. By pinpointing the least amount of changes that were needed to express the style of each brand – we created an even more flexible design system that could cater for both.

## Dark Mode Project
Dark mode had been a feature that many users asked for. Most streaming guides use a dark background as default, and they do so for a reason. The normal use case of a guide – in front of a TV, often late in the evening, after the work day is done  – does not go well with a bright white screen burning the eyes. However, since tv.nu presents a lot of information in text-based lists (the linear schedules), a sudden switch from a light to a dark UI mode would not only be popular.

But to really get people to let us know how they felt, we decided to make a one-day switch to dark mode before going back to light.
The online questionnaires we then posted gave a massive response of around 3500 respondents, and like we suspected light mode was prefered by the majority of the respondents, but we were surprised to see that dark mode was just slightly less popular. Almost half of the respondents prefered dark mode so we decided to use a switch component, letting users chose, instead of just turning the UI dark.

    ## Small Adjustments Go A Long Way
    Just as an example of the level of fine adjustments needed... users not using clickout functionality... could obviously have many reasons... in no way is this a silver bullet for all cases like this but with this project we got to know what was lacking in the information for these particular users.
    A/B AND TESTS

## Cleaning Projects
At the start of this project the typography and color handling was in a pretty bad shape in the production code. For the color... Type: Apart from a lot of "find, review and replace", I used a simple but efficient way of pinpointing all the different instances of a specific font mixin. By setting a unique and arbitrary color to each mixin, the... hunt for stray stylings became frustration-free.

## My Role at tv.nu
Throughtout all the projects at tv.nu, my role as Product design Lead was always in tight collaboration with the product owner, developers, management and the marketing team. I conducted user research and studies, facilitated workshops and brainstorms, created prototypes and specifications, taking ideas from whiteboards to implementation and following up to see what needed to be tweaked. I also managed the CSS for the web version of the app and by doing so, making sure the design was implemented correctly catering for all screens and devices. My work mostly focused on the web platform, where the design source of truth could be established as a reference for the apps as they caught up. Since tv.nu has so many – and so loyal – users it was always important to balance user needs with user expectations and to balance business and marketing goals with usability needs. Any change to the interface would stir up reactions – negative as well as positive.
