# Mobile Phone Interfaces for Seniors

The focus in these mobile phone projects was to create graphics and UI elements that were as easy as possible to discern and interprate. Since the main target group was senior citizens, a lot of emphasis was put on creating high contrast graphics and clear navigation principles.

I designed graphic components along with navigation principles and logics in close collaboration with the hardware team at Ergonomidesign (now Veryday).
