### Aerocrine

# Niox Vero

While working at Ergonomidesign (now Veryday) I took part in the development of the Aerocrine Niox Vero, a point-of-care device for assessing airway inflammation in patients with respiratory problems such as asthma.

I lead the interaction design and graphic design of the product, creating both the navigation logics as well as "gamified" versions of the software, where younger patients were to help a little girl fly across an abyss with a balloon by exhaling in an even fashion. Another version of the game was to let a cloud fly across the screen.

I carried out studies with a semi-functioning prototype on medical practitioners during an astma conference in the US and the results were very positive.
