# Eastwood Coffee Packaging

![Project Image](images/projects/32.png "Project Image")
      
Packaging concept study for a made-up line of Clint Eastwood coffee. The main idea was to incorporate Clint Eastwood's face in the coffee steam, creating associations to gunsmoke and his old western movies. Typography was kept simple and clean to not take the concept too far down the wild west route.
