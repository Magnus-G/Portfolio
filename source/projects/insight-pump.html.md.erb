# Insulin Pump

![Project Image](images/projects/insight-pump1.jpg "Project Image")

With limited screen real estate and a palette of only 256 color, the layout and graphics of the GUI demanded a lot of attention and precision. My focus in this project was to create graphics, menu maps, interaction design, as well as specifications, icons and assets for implementation.

Working with the 227 icons for the devices was a great challenge since they were to be clearly visible on both dark and light background without using any transparency channel for the edges.
