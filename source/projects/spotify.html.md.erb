I created the graphics for this Windows Phone 7 app together with Tobias Bjerrome Ahlin at Spotify. The interaction design was made by Niklas Wolkert. The reviews were very positive, Gizmodo.com wrote 'This Is How Every Windows Phone App Should Look', businessinsider.com wrote 'Gorgeous Spotify App For Windows Phone Is Finally Here'.
