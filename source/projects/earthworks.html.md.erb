### Earthworks

# Logo Design Study

Earthworks is a community-based environmental organization dedicated to creating a healthier and more sustainable environment in Boston. This logo was meant to represent a connection between the ground and the soil, by having the E (for earth) in the name tilt over 90 degrees and become the W (for works).
