### Chartpen

# Logo Design

![Project Image](images/projects/20_4.png "Project Image")

Chartpen offers a way to organize, annotate and draw trading charts. By experimenting with the shape of a ball-point pen and extending the "hook" into a bouncy, organic line chart, this logo was designed to express the essence of Chartpen. By letting the chart be drawn by the pen and at the same time let the pen _be_ the chart, the aim was to give the mark an "Escheresque" look.
