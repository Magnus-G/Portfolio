Design of the cover of 'A Whole New Mind' by Daniel H. Pink. Since the book describes the transitions from the industrial age to the information age and on to, what Pink describes as the, 'conceptual age', the concept of the design is aiming at describing these different stages and describing the 'conceptual age' as one that breaks free from the structures of the previous ones.
