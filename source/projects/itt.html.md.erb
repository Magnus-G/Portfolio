# pump station interface
      
A touch screen interface for waste water pump stations. By conducting a range of user studies with waste water engineers this interface is designed to cater for the need of quick feedback on water levels and motor status. History data on water levels is always visualized in the background and every sub-menu is reachable from every screen for fast interaction. The application was designed to be used on a desktop computer as well as a handheld, since a lot of the work is being done in cars and by pump stations. Graphic Design made together with Berke Atasoy.
